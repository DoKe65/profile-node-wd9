          p My passion is coding and learning new skills everyday. If you need help with a project, feel free to contact me - I'm sure we're going to create something beautiful together!
          p Through Team Treehouse I not only learned to code, but also discovered the value of working together and that helping others during their journey of becoming a web developer is not only addicting, but also highly rewarding.
          p I'd also like to thank all those awesome people at team treehouse for their support and kindness. I found some pretty great friends in their slack community!
